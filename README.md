# Data-Structures-And-Algorithim

## Description
This project contains Python code for implementing various data structures and algorithms. It includes functions for working with stacks, sequences (lists/tuples), and dictionaries.

## Table of Contents
1. Stacks
Question 1: is_balanced

2. Sequences (Lists/Tuples)
Question 2: remove_duplicates

3. Dictionaries
Question 3: word_frequency

## Stacks

## Question 1: is_balanced
Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that checks whether a given expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

## Sequences (Lists/Tuples)

## Question 2:remove_duplicates
Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that removes duplicates from a sequence (list or tuple) while maintaining the original order of elements.


## Dictionaries

## Question 3: word_frequency
Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that calculates the frequency of each word in a sentence and returns a dictionary. Punctuation is ignored, and words are treated in a case-insensitive manner.


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the relevant directory for the function you want to use (e.g., "stacks" for Question 1).
3. Open the Python script containing the function implementation.
4. You can run the provided sample input to test the function.
